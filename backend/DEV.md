**Actors Fault Tolerance**

Default Supervisor Strategy is used - Escalate is used if the defined strategy doesnâ€™t cover the exception that was thrown.

When the supervisor strategy is not defined for an actor the following exceptions are handled by default:
* `ActorInitializationException` will stop the failing child actor
* `ActorKilledException` will stop the failing child actor
* `DeathPactException` will stop the failing child actor
* `Exception` will restart the failing child actor
* Other types of `Throwable` will be escalated to parent actor

If the exception escalate all the way up to the root guardian it will handle it in the same way as the default strategy defined above.
